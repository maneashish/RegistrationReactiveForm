# UserRegistreation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.6.
Project: Responsive Registration Form with Local Storage
Description:
This project is a responsive user registration form built using Angular, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS. It demonstrates proficiency in creating interactive forms, implementing form validation, and managing user data with local storage.

Key features include:

Form Validation: Utilizes Angular's reactive forms to validate inputs such as username (minimum 3 characters), email (valid format), and password (minimum 6 characters).
Local Storage Integration: Ensures that users cannot register with the same email twice by storing and validating registered users against local storage. Registered users are displayed below the form in a compact table.
Responsive Design: The form and user display are fully responsive, built with Bootstrap to adapt to various screen sizes.
User Interaction: Includes buttons for submitting registration, as well as an option to clear all registered users.

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
